# Introduction
I wrote an alarm app for S60 sometime around 2006. This is an app that implements similar functionality on Android using Kotlin. There's no real need for this app, but I just wanted to toy around with the platform and the language to see, if I could do it.

As I was timeboxed with this, the actual alarm part is not that refined, more of a proof-of-concept. Also, Firebase authentication and what not was at a na√Øve levell, just enough to enable the app to save alarms to the realtime database on Firebase. Spinners and "please wait" pop ups were also not implemented.
